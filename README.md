## Using ViziCities? Please attribute it

While we love giving you free and open access to the code for ViziCities, we also appreciate getting some recognition for all the hard work that's gone into it. A small attribution is built into ViziCities and, while possible to remove, we'd really appreciate it if you left it in.

If you absolutely have to remove the attribution then please get in touch and we can work something out.
